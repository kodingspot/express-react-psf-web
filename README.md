# Express React PSF WEB
Pagination, Search and Filter use Express as API and React as Frontend.

## Backend API
To run this application, you need an API which you can clone [here](https://github.com/kodingspot/express-react-psf-api). Once cloned, follow the instructions. 

## Run Server
Inside the project root, run the following command and access localhost with port 3000:

```bash
npm start
```

> Before running the server, you should first run the Backend API.
